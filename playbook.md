## Ansible playbooks

- Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system,
  one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once,
  write a playbook and put it under source control.
- Playbooks can:
    - declare configurations
    - orchestrate steps of any manual ordered process, on multiple sets of machines, in a defined order
    - launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously
    - Playbook syntax
    - Playbook execution
    - Task execution
    - Desired state and ‘idempotency’
    - Running playbooks
    - Ansible-Pull
    - Verifying playbooks
    - ansible-lint
